        <div class="content">
            <p>Kathryn Walt Hall is the proprietor of HALL Wines and WALT Wines, and has been involved in the California wine industry since her family first purchased a vineyard in the 1970&rsquo;s. She has had a distinguished career as a successful businesswoman, attorney, community activist, and as the United States Ambassador to Austria.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Craig Hall is the owner of a collection of family-owned brands including HALL and WALT Wines and Dallas-based HALL Group. Hall is a New York Times bestselling author, civic leader, philanthropist, and the entrepreneur who started HALL Group in 1968 at age 18. Today, HALL Group’s diversified business interests include active operations in winemaking, commercial real estate ownership, development and management, structured financial lending, and early-stage investments for promising start-ups. The HALL and WALT luxury wine brands are widely recognized for quality by some of the industry’s top critics. </p>

<p>Hall actively supports new entrepreneurs, nurtures young start-ups and often speaks publicly about the importance of encouraging entrepreneurship worldwide. Together with his wife Kathryn Hall, he funded the Fulbright – Kathryn and Craig Hall Distinguished Chair for Entrepreneurship to teach entrepreneurship in Eastern Europe. Hall also founded the Dallas Regional Office of NFTE (Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship). He is the author of six published books, including his most recent, “A Perfect Score: The Art, Soul, and Business of a 21st Century Winery,” which was co-authored with his wife and listed as a ¬New York Times Non-Fiction Bestseller. </p>

A lifelong art collector, Hall believes art nourishes the human spirit and can make a profound difference in people’s lives. Throughout his businesses, pieces from Hall’s personal art collection are on public display. Important works by artists from all over the world can be found at the HALL St. Helena and HALL Rutherford wineries in Napa Valley, as well as at HALL Park in Frisco, Texas and HALL Arts in Dallas.

<p>In 2007, Hall was named a lifetime member of the prestigious Horatio Alger Association for Distinguished Americans, and was inducted into the North Texas Commercial Real Estate Hall of Fame and the Entrepreneurs Foundation of North Texas’ Ring of Honor. He was named the 2013 Dallas Real Estate Executive of the Year and in 2016 he was inducted into the Junior Achievement of Dallas Business Hall of Fame. Most recently, Craig and Kathryn were co-awarded the 2017 Master Entrepreneur of the Year award for the Southwest Region from the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year program and were named finalists in the national real estate category award program. </p>

<p>Hall and his companies are often recognized for significant achievements and civic and charitable contributions. Hall received the 2002 Obelisk Award from the Dallas Business Committee for the Arts for his long-time support of Texas artists, and was named Real Estate Entrepreneur of the Year in 2002 by Ernst & Young. In 2006, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Mortgage Bankers Association. He has served on the Board of Trustees of the American University in Bulgaria, the American-Austrian Fulbright Board and the Board of the Horatio Alger Association for Distinguished Americans.</p>

<p>The Halls have made it a lifelong mission to put people first – those in the community, those whom they employ, and those who enjoy their wines. Hall strongly believes that entrepreneurship is a catalyst that makes a difference both today and in the future, and intends to leave the world better than he found it. This is a philosophy he has been putting into action for 50 years, both in business and through his family foundation, established in 1977. Craig and Kathryn Hall work to give back across four categories; Community, Arts, Responsible Business Practices, and Entrepreneurship. They have significantly contributed to Napa and Sonoma County non-profit organizations and host a number of community-related events each year, including the annual HALL Cabernet Cookoff, an event that has helped raise over $500,000 for Napa Valley non-profits since its inception. Additionally, Craig continues to support a number of community organizations that directly impact education, healthcare, wellness, animal rights, the environment, and the arts including Clinic Ole, Legal Aid Napa Valley, Auction Napa Valley, Sonoma Barrel and Wine Auction, and Napa Emergency Women’s Services.</p>

After graduation, she was hired at Etude Wines in 2006, and planted roots in Napa Valley.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>Don Munk, Director of Vineyard Operations, provides a lifetime of knowledge and experience to HALL Winery. Having grown up in the wine industry, born and raised in the Napa Valley, Don began working in the vineyards of a family friend at the age of fifteen and has been farming ever since.&nbsp; Don holds a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Agriculture Business Farm Management from California State University, in which his studies strongly focused on viticulture. Don&rsquo;s professional experience began at Buena Tierra Vineyards, where he worked as a harvest assistant and grafter for 6 years. From there he became the equipment manager and vineyard assistant at several vineyards where he participated in vineyard development, field monitoring, soil sampling, equipment operations as well as pruning, tying, suckering, grafting, and shop maintenance. Don then took his skills to Foster&rsquo;s Wine Estates in St. Helena, CA in 1990. There he took on the role of vineyard manager where he was responsible for the operations of 725 acres. Now, Don is committed to carrying on HALL&rsquo;s dedication to the environment and eco-friendly farming, while ensuring the production of the finest wines possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I strongly believe you must be environmentally sustainable with your farming and you need to be responsible to your community.&nbsp; We can never forget that Napa Valley is truly one of the premier winegrowing regions in the world and we should farm it with reverence: Farm to the vineyard and farm to the vine. Let the vine tell you what it can do. Create a healthy, balanced scenario for the vine so that it can express itself as it should.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash;Don Munk</p>
